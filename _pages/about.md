Here is **Yijian Lu (Lucas, 呂奕鑒)**. I am currently a year-one Ph.D student in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Juanzi Li](https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/persons/ljz/) and supported by [Hong Kong Jockey Club](https://jcscholarships.hk/en). Before that, I received my M.Phil degree in Computer Science and Technology from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html) in 2024, supervised by Prof. [Irwin King](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MXvC7tkAAAAJ&hl=en). In 2022, I received my Bachalor's degree in Computer Science from CUHK as well. 
<br>My research interest is Natural Language Processing, specifically including Large Language Model, Text Watermarking, LLM Safety and Fact-checking.
